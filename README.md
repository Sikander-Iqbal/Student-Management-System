# Student-Management-System
In this project, there are three users, A student, An Admin and A Teacher. They interact with each other. A student can view, add, drop and update his list of courses. He can also view his marks in that specific course. Whereas a teacher can view which students has enrolled in his course and he can also view available courses in his domain. An admin can view, delete, add, and update the info of student and professor. Admin can also add, delete, and view new courses.
